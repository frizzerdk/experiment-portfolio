# Experiment Log

## Current Focus (December 2024)

### This Week
- **Active**: LLM Prompt Engineering - testing different prompting strategies
- **Planning**: Transformer Ablation Study - want to understand attention mechanisms better

### Ideas Queue
- [ ] Compare different RL algorithms on custom environment
- [ ] Test MPC vs PID for temperature control system  
- [ ] Fine-tune small language model for code generation
- [ ] Implement Vision Transformer from scratch

## Recent Completions

### CNN Architecture Study (Dec 15, 2024)
- **Result**: ResNet-18 with batch norm achieved 94% on CIFAR-10
- **Learning**: Architecture matters less than proper normalization
- **Next**: Want to try this on a custom dataset

### DQN CartPole (Nov 28, 2024)
- **Result**: Solved CartPole with custom DQN implementation
- **Learning**: Replay buffer size significantly affects stability
- **Next**: Try on more complex environment

## Cross-Domain Insights

### Optimization Patterns
- Learning rate scheduling helps in both ML training and control system tuning
- Early stopping concepts apply to RL training and PID parameter search
- Hyperparameter search strategies work across all domains

### Evaluation Strategies  
- Always compare against simple baselines first
- Visualization is crucial for understanding what's happening
- Document negative results - they're as valuable as positive ones

### Tools That Work Everywhere
- Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis
- Matplotlib/Plotly for visualization  
- W&B or simple logging for tracking progress
- Git for everything (obviously!)
